-the flexible box-model, or flexbox, will mitigate many of the shortcomings of css layout
-easily distributes space and aligns content as needed
-flexbox excels at anything that involves putting boxes in a line
-flexbox layouts consist of flex containers and flex items
-every direct child of a flex container is a flex child
-flexbox defines how these flex items are laid out inside of the flex container
-the flex container can have multiple flex lines, which break the flex items into multiple lines
-flexbox has a concept of two axis: the main axis and the cross axis
-these axis determine the baseline of flex containers
-the default

Flex display turns this box into a flex container.
This container's children instantly becom flex items.

We can control the direction of these flex items with the
flex-direction property.

row aligns items in a row
row-reverse reverses the order of the items in the row
by swapping the axis starting positions

column swaps the main axis and the cross-axis so the items
are laid out vertically

justify content property adjusts the positions of flex items
on the main axis

space-between evenly spaces items. this may come in handy
when styling navigation that you want to take up an
entire line with the space evenly distributed

flex-end can be used with justify content to place flex
items toward the end of a flex line

center places flex items in the center

margin auto on a flex-child will absorb extra space and
push other flex items into different positions

flex wrap property wraps items that overflow their parent
container

with flex-grow, we can determine how much the flex item
will grow relative to the other flex items

the number we pass flex-grow represents the ratio of
free space that should be taken by the list items

with the number set to 1 the space is evenly distributed

flex-grow also accepts the propety flex

use the order property to change the order of these
columns

align self can be used to vertically align boxes

the value flex-end aligns the margin edge of the column
with the end of the parent container

default value for align-self is stretch, which makes all
elements have the same height

when using flexbox in production, we need to make sure that
the pages still display well for browsers who do not
support it yet

we can use modernizr to detect flexbox support and
provide a fallback solution if needed
