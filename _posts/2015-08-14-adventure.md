I've finished my first photoshop mockup. The process was enlightening; I look forward to
improving my design skills. Designing with a graphic editing program seemed daunting
until I realized that web design primarily consists of boxes, lines, and text. Although
there is still much to learn, it's pretty simple once you become familiar with photoshop's
user interface.

This is the landing page for Adventure Thrift Company, a fictional thrift store in
Baltimore, Maryland. They sell clothing, shoes, books, guitars, cameras, cars, and other
vintage merchandise. Young women with excess disposable income are the primary target.

namely the company name, images, colors, and fonts. I went for a nostalgic, road-trip hipster theme, which just
meant searching google for images posted to tumblr. I altered the color palette and typography to continue this theme.

Implementing grids and a typographic scale will be the next step for my designs. Follow me
on twitter for updates.
